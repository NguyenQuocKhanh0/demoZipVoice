- Training ZipVoice on Emilia from scratch, see [run_emilia.sh](run_emilia.sh)
- Training ZipVoice on LibriTTS from scratch, see [run_libritts.sh](run_libritts.sh).
- Training ZipVoice on custom datasets (any language) from scratch, see [run_custom.sh](run_custom.sh).
- Fine-tuning pre-trained ZipVoice on custom datasets (any language), see [run_finetune.sh](run_finetune.sh).

> **NOTE:**  [run_emilia.sh](run_emilia.sh) is the most complete example, which covers: data preparation, ZipVoice trainnig, ZipVoice-Distill training, onnx export, and inference with all PyTorch and ONNX models.
